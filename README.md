# Assignment: Working with Virtual Machines in Azure and GCP

## 1. Start and Stop a Virtual Machine

## GCP

### Access the Google Cloud Console and create a new VM instance using Compute Engine.

## Azure

## 3. Compare and Reflect
### Compare the costs of running a VM in Azure versus GCP. Consider factors such as the configuration used, the duration for which the VM was active, and any differences in cost visibility between the platforms.

### Reflect on the ease of starting, stopping, and monitoring VMs on each platform. Which platform did you find more intuitive or user-friendly? Why?
