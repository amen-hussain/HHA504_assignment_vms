# Assignment: Working with Virtual Machines in Azure and GCP

## 1. Start and Stop a Virtual Machine

## GCP

### Access the Google Cloud Console and create a new VM instance using Compute Engine.

In this photo, I was easily able to navigate to compute engine and from there VM instances, to create a new VM. 

### Select a basic configuration (e.g., Debian GNU/Linux, e2-micro instance type).

Once "create project" is selected, a user is sent to this screen. It allows for an instance to be made and also displays the estimated monthly cost (breaking it down as well.) It was helpful that the configurations were also listed out on the left hand side as it made the screen more organized. 

### Start the VM and let it run for a few minutes.

The VM takes approximately 1 minute to start running. 

### Stop the VM and document the steps you followed.

To stop the VM, a user needs to navigate to the top right side of the VM, where the 3 vertical dots are. From there, a user can stop/start the VM. Once stop is selected, a user is prompted to confirm the decision as shown in this photo above. 

## Azure

Unfortunately, on the Azure platform I was able to naviate to the section to create a new VM, however once selecting the configurations, I realized I was unable to select the Standard B1s size. The bottom left "Select sign" is shown as light grey in the photo which prohibits the selection.

## 2. Monitor VM Costs

## GCP

In GCP, after navigating to the Billing Section I noticed there was no cost incurred by my VM during its runtime. This is likely due to the fact it was not run long enough. However, as I mentioned before, when created the VM it displayed the estimated cost of $0.03/hourly. 

## 3. Compare and Reflect

As I was unable to create a VM on Azure I cannot reflect on use or ease of it. Although, from my experience using GCP, I noted it was very easy to navigate for a first time user. I liked that the cost estimate was shown before the VM was created, it allows for a user to see which configurations may fit in their budget and which may not.
